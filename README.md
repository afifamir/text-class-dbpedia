Text Classification using DBpedia Ontology

This repository contains code for text classification using the DBpedia ontology dataset. The provided Jupyter notebook (text_class_dbpedia.ipynb) demonstrates a step-by-step process for training a machine learning model to classify text documents into predefined categories based on the DBpedia knowledge base.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the text data for classification.
Model Training: Implement a deep learning model such as Embedding Bag for text classification.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy.
How to Use:
Setup: Ensure required libraries are installed (listed in requirements.txt).
Dataset: Access the DBpedia dataset or replace it with your dataset.
Run the Notebook: Execute the cells in text_class_dbpedia.ipynb sequentially to train and evaluate the model.
Customization: Modify parameters, try different models, or experiment with feature engineering to enhance classification performance.
Dataset Information:
DBpedia is a large-scale multilingual knowledge base extracted from Wikipedia. The dataset used here consists of text excerpts from various Wikipedia articles categorized into classes such as Music, Sports, Politics, etc.

Requirements:
Ensure the following libraries are installed:

Pytorch 2.0
Portalocker > 2.0
Pandas
Scikit-learn
